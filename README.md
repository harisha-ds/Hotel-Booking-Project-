# Hotel-Booking-Project-
I worked on a real-world Hotel Booking Analytics project as part of my portfolio. Using Python, Statistics, and Power BI, I explored booking patterns, cancellations, and customer behavior to help hotels make smarter, data-driven decisions.

# Dataset Description
Column Name	: Description
arrival_date: Date of the guest’s arrival at the hotel.  
ID:	Unique identifier assigned to each booking.  
n_adults:	Number of adults included in the booking.  
n_children:	Number of children included in the booking.  
weekend_nights:	Number of weekend nights (Saturday/Sunday) booked or stayed.  
week_nights:	Number of weeknights (Monday–Friday) booked or stayed.  
meal_plan:	Type of meal plan selected by the customer (e.g., no meal, breakfast only, half board).  
car_parking_space:	Indicates if a parking space was required (0 = No, 1 = Yes).  
room_type:	Encoded value representing the type of room reserved by the customer.  
lead_time:	Number of days between the booking date and the arrival date.  
market_segment:	Booking channel or segment (e.g., Online, Offline, Corporate, Travel Agent).  
repeated_guest:	Indicates if the guest has stayed before (0 = No, 1 = Yes).  
previous_cancellations:	Number of previous bookings canceled by the guest.  
previous_bookings_not_canceled:	Number of previous successful bookings not canceled by the guest.  
avg_room_price:	Average room price per night for the booking (in euros).  
special_requests:	Number of special requests made by the guest (e.g., high floor, sea view).  
status:	Booking status flag indicating whether the reservation was canceled or not.  

# Key Insights:  
Bookings peak during mid-year, showing strong seasonality.  
Online channels and longer lead times had higher cancellation risks.  
Premium rooms and meal plans generated higher revenue.  
Repeat guests were fewer, revealing opportunities for loyalty programs.  

Through data cleaning, EDA, and visualization, I built an end-to-end analysis that highlights how analytics can improve occupancy, pricing strategies, and customer retention.  
This project helped me strengthen my analytical workflow — from raw data in Excel to actionable insights in Power BI.  


# Conclusion : 
The hotel booking analysis revealed clear patterns in customer behavior and revenue performance.   
Seasonal demand peaks mid-year, while longer lead times and online bookings show higher cancellation risks.   
Premium room types and meal plans generate greater revenue, though repeat guests remain low.  
Key factors like lead time, previous cancellations, and special requests strongly influence booking outcomes.   
Implementing data-driven strategies such as dynamic pricing, flexible booking policies, and loyalty programs can help the hotel reduce cancellations, 
optimize occupancy, and improve overall profitability.
